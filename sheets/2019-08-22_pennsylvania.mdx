# Pennsylvania

I used to wish I wasn’t from a [small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_College,_Pennsylvania) in the middle of Pennsylvania. I could be from, you know, _New York_.

(Spoiler: this weekend I’m moving to NYC to attend NYU!)

But in recent years, even though my primary [communities](https://hackclub.com/community/) are absolutely online, I’ve become really proud of where I’m from. Sure, it’s a small college town, & I live quite literally in the middle of a forest, but it’s awesome here. We have space here. In the summer, the sound outside is the cicadas in the trees. When it snows, it’s dead quiet.

I went to a public high school where plenty of kids are farmers.[^1] We have school off for deer hunting (actually).

As I’ve engaged more with my local community, I’ve become even more proud of it. My friends & I led a campaign to open gender-neutral bathrooms for all students at our high school. I’m part of a local LGBTQ+ youth group. Last winter I organized [Hack Pennsylvania](https://hackpenn.com), a 111-person high school hackathon during a blizzard. Students drove from all over the state (even Maryland!) to come. What we made happen was totally unique.

Looking ahead at my life, the cities will always be there, bustling, & growing. I’m incredibly excited (if a little nervous) to go to NYC—it’s the place I most want to be at this stage of my life. But being able to come home under the trees, I wouldn’t trade that for anything else. It’s an incredible privilege.

It felt good to update my [personal site](https://lachlanjc.me) the other day. `Proudly from Pennsylvania. Now based in NYC.`
