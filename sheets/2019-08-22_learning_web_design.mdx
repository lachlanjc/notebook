# Learning web design

Someone in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/community) recently asked me for advice on learning web design.

Here's what I said (edited).

The #1 thing, beyond any articles, is practice. I’ve made literally thousands of webpages, basically all from scratch. You just need to design a lot of things, & coding everything yourself, regardless of how it looks in the beginning, will be immensely more useful than using a template to pump out products that look better but you didn’t write all the code for. CSS is incredibly complicated, & the only real way to learn it is just using it long-term.

Try adding some constraints. I did a lot of these exercises & they genuinely helped me. Design a website with one font in one font weight—you’ll need to flex your white space & hierarchy muscles to make it communicate well. Design a website with just black & white, you’ll need a super clear hierarchy to draw attention. etc

I also would recommend staying away from designing in Figma/Sketch/Photoshop first. There, you’re designing a simulation of a webpage, & I think it’s totally different.[^1] Plus, once you’ve finished a mockup in Figma, you still haven’t shipped a real product—again, it’s a simulation—& you learn nothing about the code side. Design in the browser, with real code ([CodePen](https://codepen.io) & [Glitch](https://glitch.com) are great tools for this), & you’ll end up shipping real sites you can put in your portfolio, learn more, & I think make better results. There’s great uses for tools like Figma, like designing logos/assets/more complicated mockups, but for learning web design, write the code.

[^1]: See Jason Fried’s [Why we skip Photoshop](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop) for more. It’s from 2008 but still totally true.

## Frameworks

CSS frameworks/UI kits like Bulma & Bootstrap are totally valid for quickly building an app UI, but if you’re trying to learn web design, I suggest learning from them but not using them—since they make pre-packaged components, it’s easy to rely on them. Instead, make your own cards & buttons, & find out what you need to do that.

Two frameworks that I do suggest checking out/using are [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) & [Basscss](https://basscss.com). They both have a very similar idea—one class, like `.bold`, should do one thing, like make text bold. Combine `.bold` `.red` `.h1` & you’ve got big, red, bold text. They empower you to iterate quickly on design, while leaving the specific design choices up to you.

## Specific resources

I learned a _ton_ from David Kadavy’s (now a bit old) [Design for Hackers](https://g.co/kgs/brfr1V), which is about super-applicable design principles. He used to do a summer email course called “Summer of Design” that was great.

I highly suggest keeping tabs on some blogs like [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), too—you’ll learn small things you can do with CSS on a regular basis that you can add to your sites.

Read the spec. You’ll find out about a ton of tags, CSS properties, & uses for them you didn’t know existed.

[Steve Schoger’s Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/moments/879086180909764608?lang=en) is amazing.
[This article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fundamental-design-principles-for-non-designers-ad34c30caa7/) is worth a read.

[@jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com) is a personal hero in the world of web design for me. Two of his articles on typography really shifted how I think about it:

(Of course, [design is still about words](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3404-reminder-design-is-still-about-words). [Start in the middle](http://37signals.com/gettingreal/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php), with real text, not lorem ipsum.)

Basically all of [Adam Morse](https://mrmrs.cc)'s blog is a must-read, especially his early articles about CSS. (He built the Tachyons framework.)
