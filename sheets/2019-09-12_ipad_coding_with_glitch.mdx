# Coding from iPad with Glitch

I use my iPad Pro ~9 hrs/day, according to iOS Screen Time. I haven’t opened my MacBook in 2 weeks. It’s great.

How do I code from my iPad? [Glitch](https://glitch.com) in Safari.

How do you get started with Glitch? It’s really, really simple. You go there, tap New Project, & start coding. You can see a live preview as you work. You can code with friends, realtime. There’s logs & a terminal. You can connect a custom domain, download your code, import or export to GitHub. Glitch even lets you know when your npm packages have updates. It’s amazing.

I’ve made the [Hack Penn recap site](https://hackpenn.com), the [AngelHacks site](https://angelhacks.org), [this site & most of its posts](/2019-09-05_publishing_notebook_in_mdx_via_ipad/), & [many more](https://glitch.com/@lachlanjc) on Glitch recently.

## Drawbacks

There are three things I seriously miss: [Prettier](https://prettier.io), Vim, & the web inspector. Prettier I seriously hope Glitch will integrate, Vim I don’t expect them to, & the web inspector Apple just needs to build.

I’m doing without those for now because the iPad support so significantly outweighs them for my personal workflow. If you’re coding full-time (I’m not anymore, because college), I would absolutely try an alternative.

I’ve also documented a handful of bugs with Glitch on iPad & notified their amazing team about them, so I’m hoping it’ll be less rough around the edges soon.

(Also, if you’re using Gatsby or Next.js—I use them for essentially every site—[the end of this post has a tip to improve the experience](/2019-09-05_publishing_notebook_in_mdx_via_ipad/).)

## Alternatives

There are a bunch of other ways to code from iPad, too!

If you’re not working offline & used to a terminal text editor, grab an app like [Blink Shell](https://www.blink.sh/), spin up your own server or DigitalOcean/EC2/etc, & you’re ready to go.

This is less portable, but via @jxnblk, you can [run anything on a connected Raspberry Pi over USB-C](https://twitter.com/jxnblk/status/1147555688933154816?s=20).

I’m not running the iPadOS/iOS beta on my primary devices, but once iPadOS is released, we’ll have even more tools available. [Owen Williams is using full VSCode with it.](https://medium.com/@ow/its-finally-possible-to-code-web-apps-on-an-ipad-pro-90ad9c1fb59a)
