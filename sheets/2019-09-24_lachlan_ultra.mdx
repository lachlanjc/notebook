# Lachlan Ultra

I use the word “ultra” a lot, primary to describe myself. It’s an extracted prefix I’ve assigned my own meaning to. Ultra-passionate, ultra-weird, ultra-forward, ultra…ultra.

I feel ultra wearing bright red pants. I feel ultra belting out lyrics to Bloom or Ultralife or Generation Why. I feel ultra spearheading initiatives I care about.

It’s the opposite of small & weak. I enjoy making big statements, big movements, loud dancing with lots of gusto. I love making it ultra.

No one can say I can’t have a word for my style, & over time one became clear to me. So it’s Lachlan Ultra, & I love it. You can do it too, & there’s no one to stop you.
