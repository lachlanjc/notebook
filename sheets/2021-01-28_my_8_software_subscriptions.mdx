[![Apple One icon](https://cloud-23s9ymkc8.vercel.app/2021-01-27_img_2706.webp)](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/)

[**Apple One** Premier](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/) is Apple’s subscription bundle, including 2 TB of iCloud Storage, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple News+, & Apple Arcade shared with your family. Since my family already subscribed to Apple Music, News+, & iCloud storage, switching to Apple One Premier reduced the cost, & added TV+/Arcade/Fitness+. I’ve long loved Apple Music, switched a few months ago to syncing nearly all my files over iCloud Drive, enjoy a few shows on TV+, & [read News+](/2021-01-13_prioritizing_awareness_enables_my_focus/) several days a week. Though I never use Arcade, as I wrote recently, [Apple Fitness+ is my new favorite habit](/2021-01-22_apple_fitness_is_my_new_favorite_habit/), so Apple One Premier is a great value.

[![HEY icon](https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/bc/01/bc/bc01bceb-13d6-eb3b-1186-ae0ce3220c76/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hey-email/id1506603805?uo=4)

[**HEY**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hey-email/id1506603805?uo=4) has solved email for me. I’ve long thought I was just too lazy & disorganized to be on top of my email, but using HEY, I discovered it’s more of a tool problem than a Lachlan problem. The manual [separation](https://thesweetsetup.com/hey-email-disrupted-my-email-workflow/) of senders into [Imbox](http://itsnotatypo.com), Feed, & Paper Trail make it so much easier to keep on top of emails that are important, while giving a much more pleasant space for scrolling through the numerous newsletters I read. I find Reply Later can easily become a void, but I couldn’t go back to the overwhelming chaos of a traditional inbox after HEY. The [widgets](https://birchtree.me/blog/how-im-using-hey-email-almost-one-year-later/) are great too.

[![1Password icon](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/19/76/ec/1976ecd5-0c9f-2f7f-3b30-34f7eb118563/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?uo=4)

Password managers are [indispensable](https://brianlovin.com/security), & [**1Password**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?uo=4) is the best. It [integrates natively](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1password-extends-into-the-ios-quicktype-keyboard-with-password-autofill/) with Apple’s keychain, so autofill is seamless, will generate passwords & automatically save them on the Mac, & the family subscription lets you keep your logins privately synced but share certain passwords (like Netflix).

[![Halide icon](https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/c7/42/d2/c742d29c-8d22-8234-f61c-b3da5fc7a252/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368?uo=4)

[**Halide Mark II**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368?uo=4) is my pro camera app of choice for iPhone. Their [pricing](https://blog.halide.cam/introducing-halide-mkii-30f9f2bceac3) is totally brilliant—you lock in your price forever when you subscribe, & it will get more expensive over time. Whenever I want to shoot ProRAW, I immediately reach for Halide, with all its manual controls. I wish they’d add a manual white balance control, but the haptic feedback & gestures make it a joy. [Darkroom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746?uo=4) is my preferred photo editor.

[![CARROT Weather icon](https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/0e/ee/e1/0eeee1ed-11c3-97b5-9005-7b1b9eb1c3d9/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?uo=4)

[**CARROT Weather**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?uo=4) is my favorite weather app out there. ([Hello Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-weather/id978393692?uo=4) deserves an honorable mention, but I prefer CARROT’s design.) The [Apple Watch app](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2020-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-watch-app) is one of my most-used, by far, mostly via its excellent complication, & same goes for its widget. Today’s launch of CARROT v5 brought an [even better](https://www.macstories.net/news/carrot-weather-5-introduces-new-design-elements-custom-interface-builder-and-more/) design.

[![Craft icon](https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/13/74/18/13741839-82b9-1bcc-9e0d-f44b0328d6b9/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127?uo=4)

After about 2 years heavily [using Apple Notes](/2019-12-02_switching_from_bear_to_apple_notes/), [**Craft Docs**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127?uo=4) has 100% superseded it for me. I’m planning to write more about my setup soon, but it combines all the best elements of Notion with a super-responsive, super-polished native design. It supports double-sided links/backlinks between notes, nested notes with a ton of styling options, & the simpler structure of the app makes it feel more lightweight than Notion. The super-flexible [import/export options](https://www.craft.do/whats-new) also mean it has none of the lock-in of Notion[^1], while having great features like collaboration & web link sharing. I’m often spending an hour or several a day working in Craft.

[^1]: Notion’s idea of copying a note as Markdown on iOS is to download a ZIP file, unzip it, then open another text editor, select all, then copy, requiring several round-trips. For tasks like publishing posts to this site, that’s way too much friction.

[![Timery icon](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/f9/30/f3/f930f3d6-b6cd-4306-4c14-aa87820a49da/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544?uo=4)

[**Timery** for Toggl](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544?uo=4), for tracking how I spend my work time, is key to my workflow. After first hearing the idea from CGP Grey (listen to [Cortex #101](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/101) if you’re interested), it’s helped me be a lot more conscious about how I spend my productive time. I only track work time—I don’t track Twitter usage, exercising, etc—but it gives me a log of how I’ve spent my time, & forces me to be more real with myself about how much time I’m actually dedicating to each of my projects. Timery’s [widgets](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2020-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#timery) are especially standout, & easily some of my most-used on both my iPhone & iPad, & the same goes for its rich Shortcuts support. (“Hey Siri, stop timer” is probably my most frequent request to my HomePod.)

[![Castro icon](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/42/69/90/426990ea-34b1-efc7-23d9-7176dd85258c/source/512x512bb.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241?uo=4)

[**Castro** Podcast Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241?uo=4) is my newest subscription. After using [Overcast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?uo=4) since it [launched](https://marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast) in 2014, I was intrigued to try something with a newer design. Though I miss the Smart Playlists of Overcast, the Queue & Inbox structure I really enjoy, since I felt like a lot of episodes got lost in a long list of shows in Overcast. The features that once made Overcast unique, Smart Speed & Voice Boost, are just as good in Castro, & the design feels fresh.

</AppList>

With the exception of Apple One, where they make sense, all these apps have top-notch widgets, Shortcuts, &/or Apple Watch support. Broader than that, they’re all high-quality, native software, mostly from small indie companies. For tools I spend hours per week using, directly supporting those businesses & the creators of these projects is worth something real to me.
