# My websites look the same

If you look at the sites I make in chronological order, many are fairly similar to one another. I’ll use the same tech stack & sometimes aesthetics for several sites in a row (examples from this summer: [CO2](https://co2.now.sh) → [hackclub-emoji](https://hackclub-emoji.now.sh), [Hack Pennsylvania recap](https://hackpenn.com) → [personal site](https://lachlanjc.com), [Notebook](https://notebook-dagcpvw5y.now.sh/) → [IMA](https://ima.lachlanjc.com)). They’re [Iterations on a Theme](https://jxnblk.com/blog/iterations-on-a-theme/), one might say.

I am a designer, not an artist. My sites are not artwork for a gallery, they are designed with a specific purpose & goal in mind. Each one is for a different audience—if the [Windy City Hacks](https://windyhacks.com) site shares a lot with [Hack Pennsylvania](https://hackpenn.com), so be it. The goal of those sites is getting high schoolers hundreds of miles from one another to sign up for an event, & they don’t care about the design. As such, making each site totally unique is not a priority for me.

This is partly because I rarely start sites’ code from scratch. Each site is for express purpose of communicating information, & making them quickly & pretty “feature-complete” (design system/theme/reusable components, social cards/metadata, dark mode, server-rendering, basic accessibility, etc) is often important. The Windy website was forked from the Penn website which was forked from the [Hack Happy Valley](https://hackhappyvalley.com) website which borrowed components from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com).

I make myself [starter templates](https://github.com/lachlanjc/next-mdx-rebass-theme-ui), & often just clone or remix a previous site (I code mostly on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) these days! from my iPad). For small ideas, giving myself an easier jumping off point is often critical to making the project happen—depending on how important a project is (Hack Penn: mission-critical, hackclub-emoji: throwaway idea), if I had to start from scratch every time, the small ideas would never happen.

I’m not ashamed of making websites that look the same, & I don’t think you should either. If the websites are making the web & world a better place, making more of them faster is just clearly better. No one cares if each one I started from scratch.
