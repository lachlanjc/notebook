# Windy City Hacks Newsletters

For [Windy City Hacks](https://windyhacks.com/), I wanted to send out custom HTML newsletters, entirely from my iPad. The process I came up with isnâ€™t necessarily _good_, but hereâ€™s how I did it.

Note: This will require significant customization if youâ€™re intending to use a similar process. Also, be prepared to spend several hours per newsletter, start to finish.

I started by using a [Zurb responsive email template](https://zurb.com/playground/responsive-email-templates), because CSS + emails is a horrible combination. I spent several hours updating the design to the Windy brand, testing in various clients, etc.

- [Make Plain Text Newsletter](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/21225bcd5b494ad8acf0b3272ee3dbb1)

</ShortcutsList>

I started by composing the newsletters (with [Matthew](https://matthewstanciu.me)), focusing just on what we wanted to say. (Apple Notes works great here.) Remember, the content matters a whole lot more than the formatting :)

### Composing the HTML

I then ran the `Compose Newsletter` Shortcut, which creates a new file in Working Copy at the correct path with the basic template.

If you plug your iPad into an external display (USB-C â†’ HDMI adapter if your monitor isnâ€™t directly supported), Working Copy renders a preview of the HTML on the external display, & the code on your iPad. Fab!

Iâ€™d set up Split View with Working Copy next to Shortcuts, & Notes in Slide Over.

The next part was always super painful, because of the need to generate HTML with inline styles. For each line of text, Iâ€™d run the `Newsletter HTML` Shortcut, fill out whatever options, & paste into the Working Copy editor. Inline formatting like bold or links must be handled individually.

### Generating a plain text copy

Sending plain text alongside your HTML email is good form. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t just use the original text, because Iâ€™d always edit it while making the HTML version/reading it in my client.

Select all the HTML in the Working Copy editor, Share â†’ Shortcuts â†’ Make Plain Text Newsletter, then edit in Drafts.

## Sending a newsletter

If youâ€™re using [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/), Hack Club has an installation of [Sendy](https://sendy.co), which is honestly the best newsletter software Iâ€™ve ever used. Highly recommend it over MailChimp & friends.

> Note: Iâ€™ve previously tried TinyLetter for a hackathon, but if anyone replies to your email with an attachment (like their signed waiver form), you canâ€™t see the attachment. This is a big no.

### Generating the recipient list

Our attendees were stored in Airtable, so I did whatever relevant filtering there, then exported a CSV. (This is only available via the website because Airtableâ€™s iPad app sucks, but the website is becoming more usable via iPadOS). Then Iâ€™d open the CSV in Numbers to manipulate the columns (renaming the emergency contact name to `name`, deleting unused columns, etc), re-export as CSV, & upload the list to Sendy.

This is super tiresome, but there wasnâ€™t a clear pattern to automate, & CSV is rough to automate in Shortcuts.

### Sending it out

This part is pretty simple! Paste the plain text & HTML into Sendyâ€™s editor. Theyâ€™ve got options for scheduling, sending test emails, etc.

### Test your newsletter. Always!

Never, ever send out a newsletter without sending yourself a test copy, sometimes several, first. I would undoubtedly discover a typo, need to make an edit, find a bug, etc.


I hope this was somewhat useful. Itâ€™s not a recommendation to use this system, merely documentation of what I did if you wanted to recreate it for your own hackathon, club, etc.

Happy emailing! ðŸ’Œ
