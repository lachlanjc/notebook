# I’m not an environmentalist

Today I saw [a chart](https://news.gallup.com/poll/348227/one-four-americans-say-environmentalists.aspx) of the percentage of Americans who self-identify as environmentalists (40%), and I realized that as much as climate is a core piece of my work & identity, I don’t use the label _environmentalist_ for myself. The term brings to mind 1970s environmentalism, that in my eyes was focused on conservation and preventing development. But perhaps I’ll come around to the term.

Even though my values are strongly on the environmental side, the way I think about solving climate now brings me to solutions diametrically opposite those from that generation of environmentalism. We need to build, and fast, using the smartest versions of our brains thinking as far ahead as we can manage. We need [housing](https://edu.lachlanjc.com/2022-10-06_gw_the_housing_shortage_as_environmental_issue), carbon-free energy, carbon removal, bike lanes, EV chargers, heat pumps, desalination plants, electrical transmission, electric planes, electrofuels, we need it all. We will never get to our livable, equitable future by preventing development or stopping future destruction; we must actively transform (electrify, specifically) our built environment in the image of our livable utopia. It’s an act of creation & transformation, not prevention.

Simultaneously, we need to conserve nature. It’s an integral part of having an ecosystem worth keeping habitable. Not only for the brilliant innovations we’ve always derived from nature, or as a place to remind us why we’re in this fight, or to keep us healthy, but because we will never have the understanding or technology to replace what the ecosystems we inherit already do. (If you don’t feel passionately about this yet, the two books that convinced me are [_Half-Earth Socialism_](https://www.half.earth/) and [_Under a White Sky_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/under-a-white-sky-the-nature-of-the-future-elizabeth-kolbert/15518975).) The traditional environmental movement was right about this, but it must be addressed in a more globally-aware way: preventing an apartment building from being built to save a specific patch of forest doesn’t make sense if those people then move out into suburban homes covering more land elsewhere.

Yet I wouldn’t be surprised if over my life, I arc more towards identifying as an _environmentalist_. Maybe the previous paragraph is evidence I’m already on my way.

When I was first coming out, I identified myself as queer and avoided identifying as gay. Part of unpacking that was realizing the part of “homosexuality” I didn’t identify with was male-ness, and coming out as non-binary clarified why. Identifying as gay also lumped me in with a community I didn’t feel at home with—the one I’ve encountered in the Castro or on Fire Island, with men being creepy/exploitative toward me, a community with the ugly results of DL culture or a need to police & project a certain (masc) image still toxically embedded in its fabric. _Queer_ to me felt like the new generation, where we could drop those stigmas, live out & proud, allow for a more nuanced identity that embraced expansive gender and didn’t force us all into a gay male box. And I still describe myself primarily as queer. But over time, I’m increasingly fine with _gay_—even if it’s not the primary word I reach for personally, its community is not the one to shun. The queerness we have today exists as a direct result of the triumphs of the queer communities prior, just as climate work today rests on the _Silent Spring_s & Earth Days—and the _Inconvenient Truth_s—of the prior decades.

So if my Twitter Mastodon bio says _environmentalist_ at some point, know that I’ve made peace with the roots of the movement I’ve joined. The environmentalism of decades before me got the values right. There’s a more expansive, futuristic, optimistic vision of it possible now, one I’m actively pushing toward. There’s room enough for capitalists and socialists and climate tech bros and hardcore environmentalists in this tent. Our coalition is the only way we’ll build the future we all want.
