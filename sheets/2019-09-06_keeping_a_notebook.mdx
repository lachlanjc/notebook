# Keeping a Notebook

Like many other web developers, I’ve built myself a blog more than once, then didn’t write in it.

I started keeping my [Notebook](/) about a month ago. It’s definitely the most continuous blog I’ve ever kept.

With other blogs, I internally would set this high bar that everything on my blog needed to be perfect—a long-lasting, authoritative institution of a webpage. Why would I want to publish something that’s not perfect?

(Because I don’t have time or care enough for that!)

The Notebook format is just like publishing GitHub Gists. They’re self-contained, Markdown-files-turned-webpages.[^1]

With Notebook, I often publish a post within 30 minutes of thinking of it. I open [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com), start writing, re-read/edit, then [publish](/2019-09-05_publishing_notebook_in_mdx_via_ipad/).[^2]

Sometimes I want to write about how [I’m a big iPad nerd](/2019-09-05_windy_city_hacks_newsletters/). Sometimes it’s about [my design philosophy](/2019-09-06_my_websites_look_the_same/). Sometimes it’s [thoughts on gender experience](/2019-08-23_the_man/). My Notebook isn’t an Apple blog, a design blog, or a gender blog. It’s _my place to publish on the internet_.

There are no comments, & I don’t feel any judgement about what I post.[^3] I’m not putting my thoughts into the feeds of a thousand people I’m scared of disappointing. I can just be me. If no one reads it, or if a post were to go viral, I don’t especially care either way.

There’s a much lower bar to “writing in my notebook” than “publishing on a blog”[^4]—especially when that’s a site I don’t think very many people look at. I can get something out quickly, without feeling like it needs to be perfect. Posts are written exactly the way I speak. They have a date, but no timestamp.

If people are curious what I’m thinking about or working on, it’s public here. Or if it’s just a quick document I want to share, I can put that here. Sometimes I write several posts, one after another. I don’t set expectations about what you’ll get or how often or why. It’s just me. This is my Notebook.

[^1]: I love being able to publish a decent-looking webpage on my own domain super super easily! [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) + [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is amazing.
[^2]: If I can’t/don’t want to write a post immediately, I keep a short list (in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), before someone asks) of ideas. Honestly though, I’m way less likely to write a post if it sits on that list for a bit than if I’ve just had the idea & run with the spark.
[^3]: Including the fact that I want to use footnotes kind of often, so I do.
[^4]: Though this is pretty roughly a blog, I like [@jxnblk on non-traditional journals](https://jxnblk.com/blog/microbeats-is-the-best-journal-ive-ever-kept/).
