# Hack Pennsylvania site

Though the event ran last January, Hack Pennsylvania is one of the things I'm most proud of. I wanted there to be a nice recap of the event online, so I made it: [**hackpenn.com**](https://hackpenn.com)

## Behind the scenes

The site is built using Next.js + MDX + Theme UI, with Rebass + Emotion. Breaking it down:

- Next.js is the framework that bundles & serves the site. https://nextjs.org/
- MDX is a technology for Markdown ↔ React. It lets you use React components directly inside Markdown, & vice versa. https://mdxjs.com/
- Theme UI is a new React library for making themeable React apps. https://theme-ui.com/
- Rebass is a React component library wrapping Theme UI. It exposes components like `<Text />` for styling. https://rebassjs.org/
- Emotion is the "backend" of rendering the CSS-in-JS from Theme UI/Rebass. https://emotion.sh/
- The site is deployed on Netlify. Since the site has no dynamic content, it can be statically exported, so Netlify generates a folder of HTML & JS files when I push to GitHub it's then serving via CDN. Next.js automatically detects static vs dynamic pages & builds appropriately.

So all the content of the site is written in standard Markdown, with a sprinkling of React components wrapping parts of the site like the top banner, grid of people, etc with special styling.

Here’s an example of MDX:

```mdx
<Banner>

# Hack Pennsylvania

Write text here

</Banner>
```

Then in a JS file, define the component:

```js
const Banner = props => (
  <Box
    {...props}
    sx={{
      h1: {
        color: 'primary'
      },
      p: {
        fontFamily: 'mono'
      }
    }}
  />
)
```

The `Box` component is coming from Rebass—it's actually just a `<div>` with Theme UI [magic](https://theme-ui.com/jsx-pragma) applied. Everything inside [the `sx` prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop) is running via Theme UI. The `{...props}` forwards on all the other props passed to `Banner`—which include the Markdown content, via `children`.

The `primary` color & the `mono` font family are coming from a global theme. You can define multiple color modes, like the dark theme, & use a React Hook on any component to get the current colors based on the color mode or control the current mode. When you use `color` & `bg` inside the `sx` prop, Theme UI automatically applies the correct color for the mode. A basic theme could look like this:

```js
export default {
  fonts: {
    body: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
    mono: 'Menlo, monospace'
  },
  initialColorMode: 'light',
  colors: {
    text: '#123',
    background: '#fff',
    primary: '#f03',
    modes: {
      dark: {
        text: '#fff',
        background: '#000',
        primary: '#0ef'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you've used [Styled System](https://styled-system.com) before (also by the brilliant [@jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com)), you're familiar with the idea of themes & scales for whitespace, color, etc. Theme UI takes that to the next level by allowing props you're used to from Styled System (included in the [Hack Club Design System](https://design.hackclub.com)) like `py` & `bg` right alongside full CSS-in-JS, with full support for psuedoselectors, complex selectors, nesting, & more, via Emotion. I wrote some rambling thoughts on Theme UI & the `sx` prop [yesterday](/2019-08-14), if you're interested. _TLDR, Theme UI is brilliant._

(This isn't a great explanation & there's a lot more to Theme UI than this. If you'd be interested in more writing from me on using Theme UI, let me know!)

## The goods are on Glitch

I developed the site 100% on [Glitch](https://glitch.com), without setting it up locally. Big fan. https://glitch.com/~hackpenn

If you want to set up a site with the same basic tech stack, remix my starter project here: https://glitch.com/~next-mdx-rebass-theme-ui
