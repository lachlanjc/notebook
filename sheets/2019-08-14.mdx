- Built [Hack Pennsylvania recap site](https://hackpenn.com)
  - Made this entirely on Glitch, which was a new experience for a full JS site. Great experience now that I've got the `watch.json` files sorted out.
- Organized my Glitch profile, made some Collections for Hack Happy Valley, Hack Penn, my Hack Club, etc. I love Glitch.
- Got my Ruined by Design zine

## Theme UI

After making the Hack Penn recap site, I feel like __I finally understand Theme UI & MDX now__.
It's an incredible DX, where I don't feel like I'm writing the same boilerplate code
over & over like I do with styled-components/DS/my previous stack. You can't go back.

I _love_ how with MDX, your content is separated from your code. Makes it so much more approachable, too.

One interesting thing is the `sx` object for styling props.
Initially it looks like a downgrade—why not use first-class props like in DS?
(Historical note: this is actually a switch _back_ to how Rebass v0 did it with inline styles!
I was in 8th/9th grade when that happened.)
But once you're using it, the `sx` object prop is so much better. The syntax is easier to type & format
than JSX props, & mostly, it gives you an escape hatch. Need to do a weird selector or psuedoelement or
make a little change to a tag inside? You don't need to graduate to a full-on styled-component at the
top of the file with two lines of code in it, & do the awkward balancing act between `attrs`,
`defaultProps`, & JSX props, you can just open up `sx={{ }}` & make the change right there. __It encourages
a much healthier balance of components__—you can easily recognize when a component is getting unweildy in
your MDX & move it over to a JS file to be resuable.

Before Theme UI, I was feeling kinda done building Gatsby + DS sites. I've made like a dozen, & maintained
hackclub.com, 2019.hackpenn.com, hackhappyvalley.com, statehigh.hackclub.com, & so many others. It's not a
bad library, but I was getting tired of a lot of little patterns I didn't love.

With MDX & Next.js/Gatsby & Theme UI, I've got something new, & __it feels distinctly better__. It's going to be
awhile before this catches on, if it ever becomes at all popular, but in the meantime, like [I said about
Next.js](https://twitter.com/lachlanjc/status/1160979484637618177?s=20), it makes me want to build things.
That's when you know you've got a really incredible stack.
