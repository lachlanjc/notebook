# Migrate Reeder articles to Matter with Shortcuts

There’s been buzz recently about [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.app/), a new read-later service. I’ve wanted to give Matter a try for a bit, but have been saving all my reading links for the last year or two to [Reeder 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reeder-5/id1529445840?uo=4). If I’m going to give Matter a real shot, I need articles there I want to read.

Today on MacStories, Federico Viticci [shared a shortcut](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-starter-pack-reverse-engineering-the-matter-api-and-my-save-to-matter-shortcut/) with which he reverse-engineered the private web API for Matter. After generating an API access token with [Matter’s Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/getmatterapp/obsidian-matter), the shortcut seamlessly allows saving any link to Matter. I realized that Reeder’s shortcuts for querying its Read Later could be connected to Federico’s Save to Matter shortcut, so quickly assembled a shortcut to do just that.

First, you’ll need to set up your Matter plugin in Obsidian as Federico instructs. I ran into an issue with his shortcut not correctly running with multiple items, so [download my fixed Save to Matter shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b51b59661f6049f2a50ca3b831d238cd) instead, & pick the directory your Obsidian vault lives in upon installation.

Second, [download the Transfer Reeder to Matter shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/400f5646e4fa4458a7be942068dfc048). When you run it, you’ll get a list of all the articles in your Reeder Read Later queue. Select the articles you’d like to transfer, hit Done, & they should be seamlessly added in just a few seconds.

I love when data is [easily portable](https://appstories.net/episodes/216), & Shortcuts can be a quick, reliable way of transferring your own data between systems. Enjoy the shortcuts!
