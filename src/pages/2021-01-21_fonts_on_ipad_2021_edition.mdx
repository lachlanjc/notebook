# Fonts on iPad, 2021 Edition

Last spring [I wrote about fonts on iPad](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-04-13_fonts_on_ipad/), looking at the multitude of bad options for installing custom fonts on my favorite operating system. Good news! I have an update, & it’s quick.

**Just use [Fontcase](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontcase-manage-your-type/id1205074470?uo=4).** It has a much simpler & prettier design, it’s free, it’s made by the [Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com) & even [open source](https://github.com/manolosavi/xFonts).

In Fontcase, it’s easy to import fonts from Files using the “Import” button, & it’s more seamless setting up the system profile since it uses a single profile for all the fonts in Fontcase, versus individual profiles for each font like [AnyFont](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anyfont/id821560738?uo=4).

If you work with Figma, Fontcase works great with your Figma projects via the unbelievably-great app [Figurative](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/figurative/id1510607687?uo=4), which is somehow free. Figurative could easily charge \$20—instead of the semi-broken version in Safari, you get a fully-functioning Figma on iPad. I much prefer it to traditional computers since I can use my fingers & Apple Pencil, avoiding the RSI I get from using a trackpad/mouse. All your fonts are available, drawing works properly with the Pencil, & when you export layers it activates the native iPadOS share sheet for sending or saving to files. (If you want to save directly to a server, [Secure ShellFish](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/secure-shellfish-ssh-sftp/id1336634154?uo=4) is the way to go.)

Fontcase is a must-have utility for designers using an iPad. I’ve added both Fontcase & Figurative to [my Tools page](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/tools), & all the apps I’ve mentioned are free.
