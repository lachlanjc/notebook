# #TransRightsAreHumanRights

For those of you who don’t know, I’m non-binary.

Recently, the Trump administration attempted to begin legally redefining transgender out of existence. There are well over 1.5 million trans people in America, & many more around the world. Every day, our rights, our voices, & our bodies are persecuted.

Last week I helped organize a rally for trans solidarity at my trans-hostile Congressman Glenn Thompson’s office, where nearly fifty incredible community members came to speak out, to sing, to read, to remember, to protest. Yesterday we held another rally in downtown State College, where again dozens gathered to remind our community: we exist, we are here, & our rights are important.

This era will be remembered in social history for the ongoing gender revolution. These years are a turning point, where societally we marked a distinct shift in understanding & inclusivity. Revolutions don’t just happen, though—they happen through the tireless, unending work of the oppressed, amplified by allies. Our rights are directly under attack from the Trump administration right now, our lives are vulnerable (especially those of trans women of color, who are silently murdered at alarming rates). Every day, oppression, discrimination, bullying, violence work against the trans community.

To my cis friends: if you’ve never lifted a finger to support trans people & protect trans rights, it’s past time to start. You don’t get a pass just because you’re gay. Now more than ever, we need to stand up, stand together, fight back, & fight for the inclusive future we want & we deserve. To our wonderful allies, thank you, let’s keep going. Embody it daily by supporting trans people; vote for politicians who do the same. Shout it from the rooftops: #TransRightsAreHumanRights.
